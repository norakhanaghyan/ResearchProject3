In order to explore the aforementioned relationship, a
sentiment analysis and time series regression techniques have been implemented. The main
findings are that sentiment scores of the reviews have a significant additional predictive power
for the closing stock prices of the United Airlines. Hence, those findings demonstrate the fact
that the company should pay more attention to how customers value the service and implement
respective strategies to handle the issues that customers face. Overall, the findings of this paper
are in line with already existing, although not very extensive literature. Thus, this research may
serve as a ground for further investigations and improvements in predicting the stock prices
based on the sentiment scores of the reviews of the company.
